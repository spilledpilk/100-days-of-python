#print(states_of_america) # As you know, there are 51 states, but if you didn't, use len.
#print(len(states_of_america)) # Tells us the length of this variable.
# Coincidentally I guess that there are actually 50 states so it was good I used this.
#print(states_of_america[49]) # This will give us Hawaii.
# But what if we went beyond that?
#print(states_of_america[50]) # This will give us an IndexError. We start counting from 0-49.
# It's beyond Hawaii and there's nothing there. Out of range.
# When we're working with large amounts of data and we're not actually looking at it, it can be
# easy to get lost. Very frequently get off by one errors.

num_of_states = len(states_of_america) # 50 -> 49
#print(states_of_america[num_of_states -1]) # Receive the same error unless you add the -1.
# Okay, I understand now. See what happened was this. Len, when it counted the number of states
# gave us a number of 50. Therefore, the variable num_of_states became 50.
# The print command following that printed the states_of_america variable while searching the
# index for the 50th one, as specified by the square brackets and the num_of_states variable.
# To fix this, we have to use -1 to get Hawaii since it's out of range.
