# What will be calculated here first?
# So let's break it down.
# () is what will first be resolved which in this case is the entire equation.
# Next is exponents but there is nothing to the power of anything here so moving on...
# Multiplication and division. In this case, Multiplication would take priority as it's leftmost
# 3x3 = 9. print(9 + 3 / 3 - 3)
# Next is the division. 3/3 is just 1. So print(9 + 1 - 3)
# Finally we have the addition which is leftmost again so that's 10 MINUS 3.
# This should yield a result of 7.
# Specifically 7.0 as there was division involved, turning it into a float.
print(type(3 * 3 + 3 / 3 - 3))

# Now change it so this produces a 3 instead of a 7.0
print(int(3 * 3 + 3 / 3 - 7))
# Not sure if this was the intended solution, but that would do the job, I think.
# I merely replaced the 3 at the end with a 7 so that it would be 10 MINUS 7 giving a result of 3.0
# I also added the int data type conversion in case the question asked specifically for that.
print(type(int(3 * 3 + 3 / 3 - 7)))
# Here's the method I should have used
print(int(3 * (3 + 3) / 3 - 3))
# So now it'll print(3 * 6 / 3 - 3)
# 18 / 3 will give us 6.
# 6 - 3 will give us 3.
# Run and copy results.
print(type(int(3 * (3 + 3) / 3 - 3)))
# I believe because this is a whole number, it is an integer.
# One simple change beats doing the math in your head, you know?
