# Step 0: Screwing around
input("Hey there, user. What's your name?\n")
# This one's just for funsies. I was testing out the line break to see if it'd work.
#
# Step 1: Programming Greeting
print("Sorry Chuddy, I don't care. Welcome to my band name generator!")
#
# Step 2: Ask user about their city
city = input("So uhh, what city did you grow up in?\n")
# Create a variable here and assign input to so that this data doesn't go anywhere
# and I can print it or use it later on!
#
# Step 3: Ask user about their pet
petname = input("nice, nice. Tell me one of your pets' names now\n")
# Basically going to repeat step 2/line 4.
#
# Step 4: Combine the names now
print("Welp, guess we could go with " + city + " " + petname + " luhmao")
# Number of ways to do this step, but I will go with what I learned.
# Got a bit of string concatenation here. Successful all around! Didn't even need the hints!
# Runs just like the demo. I was able to apply everything I learned today.
# Printing, commenting, debugging, string manipulation, and variables! Solid course for day 1.
