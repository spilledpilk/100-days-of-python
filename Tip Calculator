print("Welcome to the tip calculator!") # Greetings
bill = float(input("What was the total bill? $")) #Takes user input. Turns number into a float.
tip = int(input("What percentage tip would you like to give? 10 12 15 ")) # Turns input into integer
people = int(input("How many people to split the bill? ")) # Turns input into integer

# Solution 1:
# tip /= 100   # This will give me .12. I need to turn it into 1.12
# tip += 1
# bill /= people
# bill *= tip
# bill = round(bill, 2)
# print(f"Your split is ${bill} per person!")
# Yeah, I give up. I have no idea how to make it say 33.60 in this case.

# Solution 2:
final_amount = round((bill / people) * ((tip / 100) + 1), 2)
print(f"Each person should pay: ${final_amount}")

# Final Solution (Angela's):
# tip_as_percentage = tip / 100 # 0.12
# total_tip = bill * tip_as_percentage # 18
# total_bill = bill + total_tip # 168
# bill_per_person = total_bill / people # 33.6
# final_amount = round(bill_per_person, 2)
# print(f"Each person should pay: ${final_amount}!")

# This is pretty much how the solution has it. And I ran that to compare. They both give off 33.6
# I guess I already got this right 3-4 times and pycharm was messing with me.......
# Honestly, kinda happy. I got it in one line of code.
