# What if we wanted to make our own functions? How would we do that?
# First start out with our keyword def.
# def => define a keyword.
# Syntax details: def #your function name#():
# def my_function():
#     # Hit enter and you'll get an indentation. Everything below the line is a code block that defines what this function does.
#     print("Hello")
#     print("Bye")
#
# If you were to just run your code, nothing will happen.
# The reason for it is that we haven't yet executed the function.
# It's only when we actually need it that we'll trigger it.
# We have to call the function.
# Type the name of the function and add any necessary inputs.
# In our case, we don't need any.
# To do this, just type out
my_function()
